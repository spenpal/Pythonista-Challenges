# The reindeer are gone!

We interrupt our regularly scheduled challenges to bring you a matter of utmost importance: the reindeer have broken loose!
As they flew away, the barn elves sounded the alarm, and rushed over to their computers to check the reindeer locations using the Arctic Tracking System (ATS).
Unfortunately, the trackers appear to be malfunctioning, and they can't pinpoint the locations of the reindeer. If they escape the arctic, there will be no way to track them down before they reach the population and cause mass panic.
The elves quickly explain to you that the ATS works through a network of sensor towers, and typically they'd return a set of coordinates for each reindeer. However, the sensors have malfunctioned, and are returning the coordinates of one random tag nearby (via [Taxicab Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry)), and they know that none of them are reindeer, nor will anything closer than that tag be a reindeer (the elves swiftly ignore your question of what else is being tracked). **They would like you to find all the coordinates that are *beyond* the tracked tag of each sensor**, that way they can search those zones.

The elves will provide your program with a map of the area from the ATS, and they show you an example:
```
               1    1    2    2
  -2 0    5    0    0    0    5
0    ..........................
1    ..........................
2    ..........................
3    ..........................
4    ......S...................
5    ..........................
6    ....T.....................
7    ..........................
8    .....T........S...........
9    ..........................
10   ..........................
11   ..........................
12   ..........................
13   ..........................
14   ..........................
15   ........T.................
16   ..........................
17   .....S....................
18   ..........................
19   ..................T.S.....
20   ..........................
21   ..........................
22   ..........................
```

Using the sensor at (6, 4) and the tag at (4, 6), we can assume that anything *closer* than that tag is dead space, and should be excluded. However the sensor/tag at (14, 8)/(5, 8) overlap with the first sensor's dead zone, so we can safely assume that the area between the two sensors is entirely a dead zone. Therefor, the map would appear like this:
```
               1    1    2    2
  -2 0    5    0    0    0    5
0    ......#......###..........
1    .....###....#####.........
2    ....#####..#######........
3    ...################.......
4    ..####S#############......
5    ...##################.....
6    ....T#################....
7    .....##################...
8    .....T########S#########..
9    ......#################...
10   .......###############....
11   ........#############.....
12   .....#...###########......
13   ....###...#########.......
14   ...#####...#######........
15   ..######T...#####.........
16   .#########...###..........
17   #####S#####...#.....#.....
18   .#########.........###....
19   ..#######.........T#S##...
20   ...#####...........###....
21   ....###.............#.....
22   .....#....................
```

Your output should be a **2D list**, where each coordinate is marked with a `1` or a `0`. `1` indicates an area that needs searching, and `0` indicates an area covered by the sensors. For example, the solution for the above grid would be 
```

The elves absolutely need this information by Christmas eve, so you'll need to submit before that date so they can perform their search. They inform you that their system is ready to run your code, and will expect a function called **create_map** that takes **one argument**, the map created by the ATS. That function should return a **2D list**, as explained above. They show you an example function definition:
```py
def create_map(original_map: str) -> list[list[int]]:
    ...
```
The elves also mention that the real grid may be sizeably bigger than the sample grid they've shown you.

The elves also mention that they have rewards in stock. When you inquire what kind of prizes, they lay out 4 [YubiKeys](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) and explain that they'll give one YubiKey to the person with the fastest code, one with the most creative code. They'll do this for both those who are confident in Python, *and* novices.

Good luck!
